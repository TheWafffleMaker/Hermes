## Introduction
Hermes is a Dependency injection tool for Distributed hash table for java. It allows the user to change from one maven dependance to an other. 

It's still in developpement but later will allow switching between a *[kademlia implementation](https://github.com/JoshuaKissoon/Kademlia) and *[tomP2P](https://github.com/tomp2p/TomP2P) for dht implementations. 

## Installation

For Kademlia, we [zipped the implementation](https://uncloud.univ-nantes.fr/index.php/s/Ac3M6SKR6MCrqnq), so you have to unzip it, go to the Kademlia folder through command line, and execute `mvn clean install`.
